\section{Related Work} \label{sec:related}

Strowes presented a solution to measure the TCP round trip time (RTT) \cite{Strowes:2013},
the result of which can be used to set the network delay parameter in our future simulations. 
Strowes applies different network conditions and packet loss rates in his experiments to 
obtain desirable results. Though we measure different aspects of the network, the methodology
can be employed in future work.
