\begin{abstract} 

In this paper, we attempt to measure the network behaviours of TCP 
protocol under different network topologies. We assume that one server 
is required in a company and many clients connect to the server to 
transmit data. Each host, server or client, hides behind a separate 
switch, which means no host directly connects to the other hosts without
a switch. We simplifies the network model in this paper. For our 
purpose, we leverage Mininet to simulate the network and construct 
different topologies. In order to discover the best location for placing
the server, we select all potential locations as the server to do
the simulation. The evaluation shows that ......
