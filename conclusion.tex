\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we present an automatic simulation approach to measure the 
the network behaviors for TCP protocol under different network topologies. 
We simplify our model to a topology with 7 $<$host, switch$>$ pairs and 
each switch is connected with some other switches according to the topology definition.
All data transmission goes through at least two switches from the sender 
host to the receiver host. 

We aim at finding out the best location to place the server in a scenario of one server 
and multiple clients. In a specific topology, there are different locations
for the server, based on the distance to all the other nodes. Therefore, we 
select all potential locations as server and perform simulation on them separately.
We leverage Mininet for the simulation and collect the average results 
for multiple independent runs to analyze. 

The evaluation shows that, we should place the server at the center 
of star topology and never place it at the node with only one neighbor 
in line topology, if possible. Among the three topologies, we should never 
consider line topology as an option and if possible we should always choose 
star topology to construct a network for best performance.

We have some limitations as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}. Some 
are related to Mininet itself and some can be further improved in future work.
