\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we present an automatic simulation approach to measure the 
the network behaviors for TCP protocol under different network topologies. 
We simplify our model to a 7 $<$host, switch$>$ pairs for any topology and 
each switch is connected with some other switches due to the topology definition.
All data transmission goes through at least two switches from the sender 
host to the receiver host. 

We aim at finding out the best location to place the server in a scenario of one server 
and multiple clients. In a specific topology, there are different locations
for the server, based on the distance to all the other nodes. Therefore, we 
select all potential locations as server and perform simulation on them separately.
We leverage Mininet for the simulation and collect the average results 
for multiple independent runs to analyze. 

The evaluation shows that ......

We have some limitations as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}. Some 
are related to Mininet itself and some can be further improved in future work.
