\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

In this section, we will discuss some limitations in our work.

There are many types of network topologies as mentioned in \cite{NetworkTopo:wiki},
but we only handled 3 of them in this paper. Our underlying platform for simulation
is Mininet \cite{Mininet:official}, which does not provide any mechanisms to construct
the bus topology. Also, even if we can write code to build ring and mesh topology,
Mininet itself is not able to process them because of the existence of loop in these
topologies \cite{MininetFAQ:web}. Some researchers proposed POX, which can handle the
loop routing by setting routing table \cite{POX:web}. But POX requires manual work 
to perform the simulation, and does not provide a way for automatic simulation. 
Due to the time limit, we omit this part in this paper.

Even if we did not evaluate ring and mesh topology, we can infer the results based on 
theoretical analysis and our evaluation. The ring topology is constructed by connecting
{\it s0} and {\it s6} in line topology. Then every host in the topology would have same 
behaviors as {\it s4} in line topology due to the nature of symmetry. 
For the mesh topology, if we only consider the case with all-to-all connection, we can
expect all hosts have the same behaviors as {\it s0} in star topology. Every switch 
connects to all the others directly, which means there are only 3 hops for any pair
of host along the shortest path, same as the case for the hosts transmitting data to 
{\it s0} in star topology. 

The evaluation has some problems too. Ideally, the server is connected with 6 hosts in
our simulation and so the result should contain statistics for 6 clients. But sometimes
the data for certain clients is missing. Our manual check discovered that all such cases 
happen for the farthest clients. For instance, in line topology, if {\it h0} acts as the 
server, data for {\it h6} may be failed to report. This is also a reason for us to 
simulate multiple times to obtain the average values.
