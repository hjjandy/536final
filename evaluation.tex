\section{Evaluation} \label{sec:evaluation}

In this section, we will show the results we got from our experiments. Our experiments will try to 
answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How is the overall throughput differ under different topologies?
    \item How is the fairness differ under different topologies?
    \item What is the conclusion of the experiment results?
\end{itemize}

The whole section is organized as the follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Part 1, a brief introduction of our experiment environments.
    \item Part 2, overall throughput evaluation results and analysis.
    \item Part 3, fairness evaluation results and analysis.
    \item Part 4, our suggestions according to the results we have.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environment Setup} \label{subsec:environment}
In our experiments, we use Mininet virtual box provided by official website\cite{Mininet:official}. 
The virtual machine runs Ubuntu Linux Quantal Quetzal on one CPU and $1024$ MB main memory.
The host machine we use has Intel\textregistered Core\texttrademark i7-3770 CPU with $12$ GB main memory running on
$64-bit$ Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise version.

The network delay is set as 10{\it ms} since we simulate the network in a company, 
which typically might be higher in real-world networks \cite{NetworkDelay:web}. 
The network packet loss rate is 2\%, which is an acceptable rate as mentioned in \cite{PacketLoss:wiki}.
And all network links have a bandwidth of 100Mbps. 

We simulate each server for 10 iterations, obtaining the average results for 
analysis. Each iteration lasts for 2 minutes.
