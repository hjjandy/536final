Internet is a remarkable story. It achieves huge success in many different aspects. 
As a result, more and more devices in enterprises are connected to the Internet, which brings many challenges.
One of the most challenging problem is that the performance difference under different network topology.
Let us first introduce the problem. 
As now, many enterprises have more than one buildings which may share some common network equipments like mail server or proxy server.
The topology of the network will be different. The overall throughput will vary a lot for some cases, 
and this may cause unfairness among different apartments.
In this project, we will compare the network behavior, focusing on overall throughput and fairness under different topologies.
