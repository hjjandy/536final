\section{Approach} \label{sec:approach}

We aim to measuring the performance of TCP under different network topologies.
According to our motivation, we need to build topologies containing several
switches and each switch is linked with a number of hosts. For simplicity,
we formalize the topology as containing 7 switches and each switch has only 
one host connected. We choose the number 7 because a tree topology need 7 nodes
to build a symmetric tree structure. And for other topologies, \eg star topology
and line topology, 7 nodes can build a symmetric structure.
